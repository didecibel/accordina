Hello,

here my take to make an accordina. This will be build from hardware found localy for the most parts. I had to order a M2 tap and some M2 screws (not yet visible in the files).
This is a preparatory design and it may change during the construction.
the parts are mainly alunminium profile :
flat 30mm x 2.5 (or 2mm)
flat 120mm x 1000mm x 1.5mm 
flat 30mm x 1000mm x 3mm
8mm OD / 6mm ID aluminium tube
6mm OD / 4mm ID aluminium tube
4mm aluminium rodbar or 4mm delrin rodbar
a piece of wood (will be lime or beech as i only have that around)

I will add the idividual dxf files as long as I make them (by hand)

to see it you need to open accordinaguyboitier.scad
we will see
