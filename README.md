Hello,

here my take to make an accordina. This will be build from hardware found localy for the most parts. I had to order a M2 tap and some M2 screws (not yet visible in the files).
This is a preparatory design and it may change during the construction.
the parts are mainly aluminium profile :
<ul>
<li>flat 30mm x 2.5 (or 2mm)</li>
<li>flat 120mm x 1000mm x 1.5mm</li> 
<li>flat 30mm x 1000mm x 3mm</li>
<li>8mm OD / 6mm ID aluminium tube</li>
<li>6mm OD / 4mm ID aluminium tube</li>
<li>4mm aluminium rodbar or 4mm delrin rodbar</li>
<li>a piece of wood (will be lime or beech as i only have that around)</li>
</ul>

I will add the individual dxf files as long as I make them (by hand)

To see it you need to open accordinaguyboitier.scad

we will see
